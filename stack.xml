    SpeakEasy provides a unified API for text-to-speech, music, and sound effects
    on Ubuntu. The package of the same name runs both with or without ROS.
    use the audio engines on the machine where the respective application runs.
    SpeakEasy is cognizant of both Festival, the built-in Ubuntu text-to-speech engine,
    and Cepstral, a commercial engine.

    SpeakEasy also provides a GUI that provides access to sound effects, and text-to-speech 
    on both TTS engines. In addition, the GUI provides programmable button sets for
    text-to-speech.

    Clients can use modules music_player.py, sound_player.py, and text_to_speech.py 
    independently of each other.
