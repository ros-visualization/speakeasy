  <description brief="SpeakEasy: GUI for text-to-speech and sounds on
		      a robot">

     SpeakEasy provides a sound node to run on a robot, and a GUI to
     run on a client. GUI users can type text for conversion to speech
     by the sound node. Utterances can be saved to buttons, and sound
     effects are available via buttons. Two versions, one started via
     launch/speakeasy_ros.launch separates control GUI from the low level
     speech engine control. This version can run the GUI and the
     actual speech in different ROS nodes. Use it, for example, if 
     the sound is to be generated on the robot, and the GUI on a laptop.

     The second version, started with
     launch/speakeasy_standalone.launch combines all speech engine
     interaction with the GUI file. This means that the GUI and the
     speech engine share a process, and must both operate on the same machine.
